# Focus-Pocus

This is the executable for our game Focus Pocus. It uses the Neurosky Mindwave to dynamically control in game variables for use as biofeedback therapy and entertainment. The more focused and relaxed you are, the easier the game is! This game was developed at Hamp Hack at Hampshire College in Amherst, MA in April of 2017. It won the Braini-Hack Challenge! The game is playable without the Neurosky Mindwave to show game functionality, but, obviously, the biofeedback functionality will not work.
